input_files: contains input files

output_files: contains output files that are generated through main.cpp (respectively having the same                   name, but .out extension)

compile the main.cpp using: g++ main.cpp
(this will generate an a.out file)

Then run the code using: ./a.out input_files/input_file_name.in output_files/output_file_name.out

(We are running the same code for different input file using the command line arguments, to generate different respective output files)
